- Docker Ã© opcional caso queira rodar em container.

1. Clone the repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```

2. Install dependencies with Maven
3. Install [MongoCompass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
   
### Accessing the API

- Start the application with Maven
- Make sure that MongoDB Compass is running locally at mongodb://localhost:27017/Fiado-Safe.

1. **Authentication**
The API uses Spring Security for authentication control. The following roles are available:

```
ROLE_USER - Standard user role for logged-in users.
ROLE_ADMIN - Admin role for managing partners (registering new partners).
```
To access protected endpoints as an ADMIN user, provide the appropriate authentication credentials in the request header.

```json
     {
       "login": "ADMINISTRADOR"
       "password": "123456789",
       "role": "ADMIN"
     }
```
- To access the protected endpoints, you must first obtain a JWT token.
- Use the /auth/login endpoint to authenticate and obtain the token.
- Send a POST request to /auth/login with the following JSON body: 
 ```json
     {
       "login": "user",
       "password": "password"
     }
```
- The JWT token will be returned in the response. Store it and add it to the headers of your requests to authenticate subsequent calls:
 ```
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
- NOTE: POST, PUT, and DELETE requests require the user to be ADMIN
